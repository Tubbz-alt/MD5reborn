-> Get directory to check for files make it abstract so it can be a file or database

-> check for the latest hashed words depending on abstraction above

-> put it in the ThreadManager class 

-> need a way to generate new words fasts -> using looping or numbers

-> Give threads jobs when a thread is done give it a new word. -> thread has a preprogrammed size it needs to hash.

-> multiple threads work on multiple files.

-> when program reboots it has to finish possibly multiple files. (make this easy so you can quit with command file.
 This lets the files finish for the time being.)

-> need a command console and a console to display text (maybe not in linux)
